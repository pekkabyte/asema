Platform browser is type of a web browser for interacting with multisided markets. Inspired by my Master's Thesis "Exploring business model for open digital platform from customer and operating system owner viewpoints" [https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202301291794](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202301291794)

[Platform browser](https://github.com/pekkabyte/platform-browser) repository will be for specification of the concept and this Asema repository for its implementation, named after the Finnish word for "station". As a platform browser can be seen as a railway station housing platform(s) that connect people on different sides of a market running on parallel tracks, so I figured the name would fit well.
